This is the repository for our work in the paper titled 'An Augmented SMS Spam Dataset and Performance Evaluation of Short-Text Representations for SMS Spam Detection'.

There are two datasets, namely,
1. Baseline: It is the same data as provided by https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection, we refer to it as the classical dataset in our work.
2. Augmented: This is an extended dataset curated by us, wherein each spam SMS message is further categorized into indecent, malicious, promotional, and updates.
